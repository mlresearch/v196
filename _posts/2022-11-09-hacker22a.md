title: On the Surprising Behaviour of node2vec
abstract: Graph embedding techniques are a staple of modern graph learning research.
  When using embeddings for downstream tasks such as classification, information about
  their stability and robustness, i.e., their susceptibility to sources of noise,
  stochastic effects, or specific parameter choices, becomes increasingly important.
  As one of the most prominent graph embedding schemes, we focus on \texttt{node2vec}
  and analyse its embedding quality from multiple perspectives. Our findings indicate
  that embedding quality is unstable with respect to parameter choices, and we propose
  strategies to remedy this in practice.
